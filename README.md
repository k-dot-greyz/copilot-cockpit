## Purpose

Side-by-side interactive dashboard visualizing every GitHub Copilot agent surface and their integration into the GlitchWorks / zenOS development workflow.

**Built to answer:** *“what can each agent actually do, and where does it fit in our pipeline?”*

## 🚀 PR Triage Happy Path (Epic: COCKPIT-TRIAGE-001)

The dashboard provides a dedicated, high-speed triage interface built specifically for maintainers to handle bot PR floods and prioritize human reviews in under two minutes.

### The Happy Path Flow

| Step | Actor Action | System Response |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | Open dashboard (no stored token) | Prompt with a secure Token Modal requesting a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with `repo` scope. |
| **2** | Input PAT and click **Connect** | `validateToken` runs. On success, the modal closes, storing the PAT in `sessionStorage` (never on disk) and displaying `@username` in the header. |
| **3** | — *(automatic)* | Triggers a paginated fetch of open PRs from `k-dot-greyz/dev-master` with an active loading progress bar. |
| **4** | Scan Stat Bar | Displays real-time counts: **Total PRs** · **Ready for Review** · **Drafts** · **Human Authors** · **Bot Authors** · **🚨 Flood Detected** (if any). |
| **5a** | **Flood Path:** Click **☢ Nuke N PRs** on the flood alert | Triggers a confirmation dialog. Upon approval, sequentially closes all flood PRs and deletes their head branches with a progress bar, clearing the flood lane. |
| **5b** | **Human Path:** Review **🔥 Your PRs — Ready for Review** | Renders prioritized PR cards sorted newest-first, complete with author badges, draft/ready state, relative timestamps, and direct **View** links. |
| **6** | Optional: Checkbox-select PRs → **Close N selected** | Triggers confirmation, then bulk-closes selected PRs. Any partial failures are gracefully surfaced in a top-level error banner. |
| **7** | Press **R** or click **↻ Refresh** | Re-fetches all open PRs. If the repository is clean, displays: *“No open PRs found. 🎉”* |

### Priority Lane Order (Top → Bottom)

1. **🔥 Human — Ready for Review** *(action first)*
2. **📝 Human — Drafts**
3. **🧪 Bot Test/Security Coverage**
4. **🤖 Bot — Other**
5. **🚨 Bot Flood (Duplicates)**
6. **👥 External**

### Automated Verification

This happy path is fully verified by an end-to-end integration test in **Vitest**:
- **Test File:** `src/lib/happy-path.test.ts`
- **What it covers:** Token validation, paginated fetching, stat calculation, multi-lane categorization, and a full mock-nuke sequence (sequentially closing 12 flood PRs and deleting their branches) followed by post-nuke state verification.
- **Run command:** `npm run test`
